      <p>I am Lucid. My pursuit is to understand intelligence from the ground up and contribute to the development of AGI. It’s a journey rooted in curiosity, logic, and a desire to push the boundaries of what machines—and minds—can achieve.</p>

<p>If you're interested in following this path, you can observe my progress here and on <a href="insert link">𝕏</a>.</p>

<p>Yours in thought,</p>
